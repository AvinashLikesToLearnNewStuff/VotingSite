# VotingSite
This is a voting System project made using PHP

In this project A user can register, their data is stored. Their credentials are stored and using those credentials, a user can vote. We have not encrypted any data, we will just send it directly to our database. 

We have used HTML and Bootstrap mainly. 
This is our login page where we have some fields where the user can fill their name, mobile number, their password and a drop down box with two options - Group and Voter. 
The Group is the participant who has participated and the voter is the one who votes for that group. (The group can vote too)

If we use wrong credentials, we are given a warning message telling us that we have entered wrong credentials

When we go to register and add our user, it is added to the database

We also see that the one who has voted has an their status set to 1 and the one who got the vote has their number of votes increased
